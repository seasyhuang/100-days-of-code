# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: Nov 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started setting up Xcode, worked on Basic HTML and HTML5 on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Xcode is still downloading, so I started doing FCC lessons while waiting for it to finish. Swift on playground was very basic, so I didn't continue. Read a lot of pages on getting set up before giving up and following a youtube tutorial.
