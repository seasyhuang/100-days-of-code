# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: Nov 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built first iOS app following a YouTube tutorial!

**Thoughts**: Won't pay for the course - look at all available YouTube resources first.

### Day 2: Nov 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More FCC lessons.

**Thoughts**: Not much time today.


### Day 1: Nov 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started setting up Xcode, worked on Basic HTML and HTML5 on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Xcode is still downloading, so I started doing FCC lessons while waiting for it to finish. Swift on playground was very basic, so I didn't continue. Read a lot of pages on getting set up before giving up and following a youtube tutorial.
